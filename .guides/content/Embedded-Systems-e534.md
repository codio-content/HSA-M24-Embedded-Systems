Computers are everywhere.  Your car, your phone, your television, even appliances like an automatic coffee maker have an embedded computer.  Think about all of the information that a modern television has to do, and what it would take to control all of the tasks.

For example, for a television to display a video and sound, a digital signal is received either through cable or over the airwaves.  This digital signal contains the information about the image and audio for the program on that channel but to save bandwidth, the signal is compressed.  A television must decompress the data, separate the video from the audio and produce either an image or a sound.

The television also has a series of menu items to adjust preferences of the user.  This may include brightness, hue, volume, etc.  Every image and sound needs to have these filters applied to control for the settings of the user.
